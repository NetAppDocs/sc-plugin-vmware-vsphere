You need to use the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere management GUI to stop, disable, or enable the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere appliance.

== Access the maintenance console

You can manage your application, system, and network configurations by using the maintenance console for SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere. You can change your administrator password, maintenance password, generate support bundles, and start remote diagnostics.

.Before you begin

Before stopping and restarting the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere service, you should suspend all schedules.

.About this task

* The defaults are “maint” as the username and “admin123” as the password to log in to the maintenance console for SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere.
+
TIP: After deployment, modify the default login credentials.

* You must set a password for the “diag” user while enabling remote diagnostics.
+
To obtain the root user permission to execute the command, use the sudo <command>.

.Steps

. From the VMware vSphere web client, select the VM where the SnapCenter VMware plug-in is located.
. Right-click the VM, then on the *Summary* tab of the virtual appliance click *Launch Remote Console* to open a maintenance console window.
+
The logon defaults for the SnapCenter VMware plug-in maintenance console are as follows:
+
Username: `maint`
Password: `admin123`
+

== Modify the SnapCenter VMware Plug-in password from the maintenance console

If you do not know the admin password for the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere management GUI, you can set a new password from the maintenance console.

.Before you begin

Before stopping and restarting the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere service, you should suspend all schedules.

.About this task

You must use the default `“maint”` as the username and `“admin123”` as the password to log in to the maintenance console of the SnapCenter VMware plug-in.

.Steps

. From the VMware vSphere web client, select the VM where the SnapCenter VMware plug-in is located.
. Right-click the VM, then on the *Summary* tab of the virtual appliance click *Launch Remote Console* to open a maintenance console window.
+
The logon defaults for the SnapCenter VMware plug-in maintenance console are as follows:
+
Username: `maint`
Password: `admin123`
+

. Enter “*1*” for Application Configuration.
. Enter “*4*” for Change username or password.
. Enter the new password.
+
The SnapCenter VMware virtual appliance service is stopped and restarted.

== Create and import certificates

The SnapCenter VMware plug-in employs SSL encryption for secure communication with the client browser. While this does enable encrypted data across the wire, creating a new self-signed certificate, or using your own Certificate Authority (CA) infrastructure or a third party CA ensures that the certificate is unique for your environment. See the https://kb.netapp.com/Advice_and_Troubleshooting/Data_Protection_and_Security/SnapCenter/How_to_create_and_or_import_an_SSL_certificate_to_SnapCenter_Plug-in_for_VMware_vSphere_(SCV)[KB article: How to create and/or import an SSL certificate to VMware plug-in for SnapCenter^].

== Unregister SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere from vCenter
//Updated for BURT 1378132, March 2021 Madhulika (Changed the title)

If you stop the SnapCenter VMware plug-in service in a vCenter that is in Linked Mode, resource groups are not available in all the linked vCenters, even when the SnapCenter VMware plug-in service is running in the other linked vCenters.

You must unregister the SnapCenter VMware plug-in extensions manually.

.Steps

. On the linked vCenter that has the SnapCenter VMware plug-in service stopped, navigate to the Managed Object Reference (MOB) manager.
. In the Properties option, select Extension Manager to display a list of the registered extensions.
. Unregister the extensions `com.netapp.scvm.webclient` and `com.netapp.aegis`.

== Disable and enable SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere

If you no longer need the SnapCenter data protection features, you must change the configuration of the SnapCenter VMware plug-in. For example, if you deployed the plug-in in a test environment, you might need to disable the SnapCenter features in that environment and enable them in a production environment.

.Before you begin

* You must have administrator privileges.
* Make sure that no SnapCenter jobs are running.

.About this task

When you disable the SnapCenter VMware plug-in, all resource groups are suspended and the plug-in is unregistered as an extension in vCenter.

When you enable the SnapCenter VMware plug-in, the plug-in is registered as an extension in vCenter, all resource groups are in production mode, and all schedules are enabled.

.Steps

. Optional: Back up the SnapCenter VMware plug-in MySQL repository in case you want to restore it to a new virtual appliance.
+
link:scpivs44_back_up_the_snapcenter_plug-in_for_vmware_vsphere_mysql_database.html[Back up the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere MySQL database].
. Log in to the SnapCenter VMware plug-in management GUI using the format `https://<OVA-IP-address>:8080`.
+
The IP of the SnapCenter VMware plug-in is displayed when you deploy the plug-in.

. Click *Configuration* in the left navigation pane, and then unselect the Service option in the *Plug-in Details* section to disable the plug-in.
. Confirm your choice.

** If you only used the SnapCenter VMware plug-in to perform VM consistent backups
+
The plug-in is disabled, and no further action is required.

** If you used the SnapCenter VMware plug-in to perform application-consistent backups
+
The plug-in is disabled and further cleanup is required.

.. Log in to VMware vSphere.
.. Power down the VM and then delete the VM.
// Updated for BURT 1378132
.. In the left navigator screen, right-click the instance of the SnapCenter VMware plug-in (the name of the `.ova` file` `that was used when the virtual appliance was deployed) and select *Delete from Disk*.
.. Log in to SnapCenter and remove the vSphere host.

== Remove SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere

If you no longer need to use the SnapCenter data protection features, you must disable the SnapCenter VMware plug-in to unregister it from vCenter, then remove the SnapCenter VMware plug-in from vCenter, and then manually delete leftover files.

.Before you begin

* You must have administrator privileges.
* Make sure that no SnapCenter jobs are running.

.Steps

. Log in to the SnapCenter VMware plug-in management GUI using the format `https://<OVA-IP-address>:8080`.
+
The IP of the SnapCenter VMware plug-in is displayed when you deploy the plug-in.

. Click *Configuration* in the left navigation pane, and then unselect the Service option in the *Plug-in Details* section to disable the plug-in.
. Log in to VMware vSphere.
. In the left navigator screen, right-click the instance of the SnapCenter VMware plug-in (the name of the `.ova` file that was used when the virtual appliance was deployed) and select *Delete from Disk*.
. Manually delete the following files in `/etc/vmware/vsphere-ui/vc-packages/vsphere-client-serenity/com.netapp.scvm.webclient-4.5.0.5942045/plugins` folder of the vCenter server:
// Updated for BURT 1378132
+
`vsc-httpclient3-security.jar`
`scv-api-model.jar`
`scvm_webui_service.jar`
`scvm_webui_ui.war`
`gson-2.5.jar`

. If you used the SnapCenter VMware plug-in to support other SnapCenter plug-ins for application-consistent backups, log in to SnapCenter and remove the vSphere host.

.After you finish

The virtual appliance is still deployed but the SnapCenter VMware plug-in is removed.

After removing the host VM for the SnapCenter VMware plug-in, the plug-in might remain listed in vCenter until the local vCenter cache is refreshed. However, because the plug-in was removed, no SnapCenter VMware vSphere operations can be performed on that host. If you want to refresh the local vCenter cache, first make sure the appliance is in a Disabled state on the SnapCenter VMware plug-in Configuration page, and then restart the vCenter web client service.
