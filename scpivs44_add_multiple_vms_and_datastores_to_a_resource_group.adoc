You can add multiple resources to an existing resource group by using the SnapCenter VMware vSphere web client Edit Resource Group wizard.

A resource group can contain one of the following:

* Any combination of traditional VMs and SAN and NAS datastores (vVol datastores not supported).
* One FlexGroup datastore (spanning VMs are not supported).
* One or more FlexVol datastores (spanning VMs are supported).
* One or more vVol VMs.
* All vVol VMs with a specified vCenter tag.
* All vVol VMs in a specified folder.

[NOTE]
vVol VMs that span multiple vVol datastores are not supported because SnapCenter only backs up vVols in the primary, selected, vVol datastore. 

.Steps

. In the left Navigator pane of the VMware vSphere web client, click *Resource Groups*, then select a resource group, and then click image:scpivs44_image39.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image] *Edit Resource Group* to start the wizard.

. On the *Resource* page, do the following:
.. In the Datastores field, navigate to the VMs or datastores that you want to add.
.. In the Available entities list, select one or more VMs or datastores you want to add to the resource group, then click *>* to move your selection to the Selected entities list. You can move all the available entities by clicking *>>*.
+
By default, the Available entities list displays the Datacenter object. You can click a datastore to view the VMs within the datastore and add them to the resource group.
+
When you click *Next*, the system first checks that SnapCenter manages and is compatible with the storage on which the selected VMs or datastores are located. If the message `Some entities are not SnapCenter compatible` is displayed, then a selected VM or datastore is not compatible with SnapCenter. See link:scpivs44_create_resource_groups_for_vms_and_datastores.html#manage-compatibility-check-failures[Manage compatibility check failures] for more information.

. Repeat Step 2 for each VM or datastore that you want to add.
. Click *Next* until you reach the *Summary* page, and then review the summary and click *Finish*.
