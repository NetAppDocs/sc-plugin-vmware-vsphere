You can add multiple VMs and datastores to any existing resource group by using the SnapCenter  VMware vSphere web client Edit Resource Group wizard.

.About this task

You can add SAN and NAS datastores but not VSAN or VVOL datastores.

.Steps

. In the left Navigator pane of the VMware vSphere web client, click *Resource Groups*, then select a resource group, and then click image:scpivs44_image39.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image] *Edit Resource Group* to start the wizard.
. On the *Resource* page, in the Available entities list, select a VM or datastore you want to add to the resource group, then click *>* to move your selection to the Selected entities list. You can move all the available entities by clicking *>>*.

By default, the Available entities list displays the Datacenter object. You can click a datastore to view the VMs within the datastore and add them to the resource group.
+
When you click *Next*, the system first checks that SnapCenter manages and is compatible with the storage on which the selected VMs or datastores are located. If the message `Some entities are not SnapCenter compatible` is displayed, then a selected VM or datastore is not compatible with SnapCenter. See link:scpivs44_create_resource_groups_for_vms_and_datastores.html#manage-compatibility-check-failures[Manage Compatibility Check Failures] for more information.

. Repeat Step 2 for each VM or datastore that you want to add.
. Click *Next* until you reach the *Summary* page, and then review the summary and click *Finish*.
