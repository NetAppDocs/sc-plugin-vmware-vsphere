To perform backup operations on demand using the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere REST APIs, you must follow the prescribed sequence of REST API calls.

For each REST API, add `\https://<server>:<port>` at the front of the REST API to form a complete endpoint.

Note the *resourceGroupId* and the *policyId* for the resource group you want to back up.
|2
|`/4.1/resource-groups/backupnow`
|`Run a backup on a Resource Group` backs up the resource group on demand.
Pass the *resourceGroupId* and the *policyId* from Step 1.
