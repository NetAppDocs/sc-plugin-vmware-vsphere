The SnapCenter VMware plug-in includes a MySQL database (also called an NSM database) that contains the metadata for all jobs performed by the plug-in. You should back up this repository regularly.

You should also back up the repository before performing migrations or upgrades.

.Before you begin

Do not start a job to back up the MySQL database when an on-demand backup job is already running.

.Steps

. From the VMware vSphere web client, select the VM where the SnapCenter VMware plug-in is located.
. Right-click the VM, then on the *Summary* tab of the virtual appliance click *Launch Remote Console* *or Launch Web Console* to open a maintenance console window.

. From the Main Menu, enter option *1) Application Configuration.*
. From the Application Configuration Menu, enter option *6) MySQL backup and restore.*
. From the MySQL Backup and Restore Configuration Menu, enter option *1) Configure MySQL backup*.
. At the prompt, enter the backup location for the repository, the number of backups to keep, and the time the backup should start.
+
All inputs are saved when you enter them. When the backup retention number is reached, older backups are deleted when new backups are performed.
+
[TIP]
Repository backups are named "backup-<date>". Because the repository restore function looks for the "backup" prefix, you should not change it.
