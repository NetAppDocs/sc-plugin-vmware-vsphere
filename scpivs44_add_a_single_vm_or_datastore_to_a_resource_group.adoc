You can quickly add a single VM or datastore to any existing resource group managed by SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere.

.About this task

You can add SAN and NAS datastores but not VSAN or VVOL datastores.

.Steps

. In the VMware vSphere client GUI, click *Menu* in the toolbar, and navigate to the VM or datastore that you want to add.
. In the left navigator pane, right-click on the VM or datastore, select *SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere* > *Add To Resource Group* from the secondary drop-down list.
+
The system first checks that SnapCenter manages and is compatible with the storage system on which the selected VM is located and then displays the *Add to Resource Group* page. If the message `SnapCenter Compatibility Error` is displayed, then the selected VM is not compatible with SnapCenter and you must first add the appropriate storage VM to SnapCenter.

. In the *Add To Resource Group* page, select a resource group, and then click *OK*.
+
When you click *OK*, the system first checks that SnapCenter manages and is compatible with the storage on which the selected VMs or datastores are located.
+
If the message `Selected <resource-name> is not SnapCenter compatible` is displayed, then a selected VM or datastore is not compatible with SnapCenter.  See link:scpivs44_create_resource_groups_for_vms_and_datastores.html#manage-compatibility-check-failures[Manage compatibility check failures] for more information.
