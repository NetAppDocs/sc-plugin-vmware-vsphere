You can modify the vCenter logon credentials that are configured in SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere. These settings are used by the plug-in to access vCenter.
When you change the vCenter password, you need to unregister ONTAP tools and re-registered it with the new password for the vVol backups to work seamlessly.

.Before you begin

You must know the IP address and the log on credentials for the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere management GUI. You must also note down the MFA token generated from the maintenance console.

* The IP address was displayed when the SnapCenter VMware plug-in was deployed.
* Use the log in credentials provided during the deployment of the SnapCenter VMware plug-in or as later modified.
* Generate a 6-digit MFA token using the maintenance console System Configuration options.

.Steps

. Log in to the SnapCenter VMware plug-in management GUI.

Use the format `https://<appliance-IP-address>:8080`
