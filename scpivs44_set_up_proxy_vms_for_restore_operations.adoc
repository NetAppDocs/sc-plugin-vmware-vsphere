If you want to use a proxy VM for attaching a virtual disk for guest file restore operations, you must set up the proxy VM before you begin the restore operation. Although you can set up a proxy VM at any time, it might be more convenient to set it up immediately after the plug-in deployment completes.

. In the *Proxy VM* dialog box, complete the information, and then click *Save*.
