To modify built-in schedules for VMware vSphere client jobs using the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere REST APIs, you must follow the prescribed sequence of REST API calls.

Built-in schedules are the schedules that are provided as part of the product; for example, the MySQL database dump schedule. You can modify the following schedules:
`Schedule-DatabaseDump`
`Schedule-PurgeBackups`
`Schedule-AsupDataCollection`
`Schedule-ComputeStorageSaving`
`Schedule-PurgeJobs`

For each REST API, add `\https://<server>:<port>` at the front of the REST API to form a complete endpoint.

Note the schedule name that you want to modify and the associated cron expression.
|2
|`/4.1/schedules`
|`Modify any built-in schedule` changes the named schedule.
Pass the schedule name from Step 1 and create a new cron expression for the schedule.
