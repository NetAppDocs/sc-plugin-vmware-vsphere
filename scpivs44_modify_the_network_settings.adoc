You can modify the network settings that are configured in SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere. These settings are used by the plug-in to access vCenter.

.Before you begin

You must know the IP address and the log on credentials for the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere management GUI.

* The IP address was displayed when the SnapCenter VMware plug-in was deployed.
* Use the log in credentials provided during the deployment of the SnapCenter VMware plug-in or as later modified.

.Steps

. Log in to the SnapCenter VMware plug-in management GUI.
+
Use the format `https://<appliance-IP-address>:8080`

. Click the Settings icon in the top toolbar.

. On the *Settings* page, in the *Network Settings* section, click *IPv4* or *IPv6*, and then click *Edit*.
+
Enter the new information and click *Save*.

. If you are removing a network setting, do the following:
+
** IPv4: In the *IP Address* field, enter `0.0.0.0` and then click *Save*.
** IPv6: In the *IP Address* field: enter `: :0`  and then click *Save*.

[NOTE]
If you are using both IPv4 and IPv6, you cannot remove both network settings. The remaining network must specify the DNS Servers and Search Domains fields.
