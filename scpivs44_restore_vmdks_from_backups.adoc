You can restore existing VMDKs, or deleted or detached VMDKs, from either a primary or secondary backup.

#You can restore one or more virtual machine disks (VMDKs) on a VM to the same datastore. Beginning in SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere 4.5, you can restore to the original datastore or to an alternate datastore.#


[NOTE]
#When restoring to a different location, SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere must be running in the linked vCenter that is the destination for the restore operation.#
//Burt 1382316 March 2021 Ronya

[TIP]
#For improved performance of restore operations, enable the VMware application vStorage API for Array Integration (VAAI).#

.Before you begin

* A backup must exist.
+
You must have created a backup of the VM using the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere.

* The VM must not be in transit.
+
The VM that you want to restore must not be in a state of vMotion or Storage vMotion.

.About this task

* If the VMDK is deleted or detached from the VM, then the restore operation attaches the VMDK to the VM.
* A restore operation might fail if the storage tier of the FabricPool where the VM is located is unavailable.
* Attach and restore operations connect VMDKs using the default SCSi controller. VMDKs that are attached to a VM with a NVME controller are backed up, but for attach and restore operations they are connected back using a SCSi controller.

.Steps

. In the VMware vSphere web client GUI, click *Menu* in the toolbar, and then select *VMs and Templates* from the drop-down list.
. In the left Navigator pane, right-click a VM, then select *NetApp SnapCenter* in the drop-down list, and then select *Restore* in the secondary drop-down list.
. In the *Restore* wizard, on the Select Backup page, select the backup copy that you want to restore from.
+
You can search for a specific backup name or a partial backup name, or you can filter the backup list by clicking the filter icon and selecting a date and time range, selecting whether you want backups that contain VMware Snapshots, whether you want mounted backups, and primary or secondary location. Click *OK* to return to the wizard.

. On the *Select Scope* page, select the restore destination by clicking *Particular disk* in the *Restore scope* field drop-down list and then click *Next*.

|Restore to an alternate datastore on the same ESXi host or, beginning in SnapCenter Plug-in VMware vSphere 4.5, to an alternate ESXi host managed by the same vCenter in linked mode.

In the Datastore selection table, you can select or unselect any VMDKs.
