If you are upgrading to a new patch of the same release, you must clear the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere cache on the vCenter Web Server and restart the server before the upgrade or registration.

If the plug-in cache is not cleared, then recent jobs are not displayed in the Dashboard and job monitor in the following scenarios:

* SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere was deployed using vCenter, and then later upgraded to a patch in the same release.

* The SnapCenter VMware virtual appliance was deployed in vCenter 1. Later, this SnapCenter VMware plug-in was registered to a new vCenter2. A new instance of the SnapCenter VMware plug-in is created with a patch and registered to vCenter1. However, because vCenter1 still has the cached plug-in from the first SnapCenter VMware plug-in without the patch, the cache needs to be cleared.

== Steps for clearing the cache

. Locate the `vsphere-client-serenity` folder, then locate the `com.netapp.scvm.webclient-<release-number>` folder and delete it.
+
The folder name changes for each release.
+
See the VMware documentation for the location of the `vsphere-client-serenity` folder for your operating system.

. Restart the vCenter Server.
+
You can then upgrade the SnapCenter VMware plug-in.
