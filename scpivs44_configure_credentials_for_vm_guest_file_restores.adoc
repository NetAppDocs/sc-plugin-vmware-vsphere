The following table lists the credential requirements for guest restore operations.

| |User access control enabled |User access control disabled

|Domain user
|A domain user with “administrator” as the username works fine. For example, “NetApp\administrator”.
However, a domain user with “xyz” as the username that belongs to a local administrator group will not work. For example, you cannot use “NetApp\xyz”.

However, a local user with “xyz” as the username that belongs to a local administrator group will not work.
|Either a local user with “administrator” as the username or a local user with “xyz” as the username that belongs to a local administrator group, works fine.
However, a local user with “xyz” as the username that does not belong to local administrator group will not work.
