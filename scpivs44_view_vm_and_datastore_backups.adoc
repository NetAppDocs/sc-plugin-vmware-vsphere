When preparing to back up or restore a VM or datastore, you might want to see all the backups available for that resource and view the details of those backups.

.About this task

Browsing large file folders, such as 10k file folders, might take one or more minutes the first time. Subsequent browsing sessions take less time.

.Steps

. Log in to the vCenter Server.
. Navigate to the *Inventory* page and select a datastore or a VM.
. In the right pane, select *Configure* > *SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere* > *Backups*.

If the *Enable Secondary Snapshot Locking* option is not selected during the policy creation stage, it takes the value set for the *Enable Primary Snapshot Locking* option by default. In the backups list, the hyphen in the *Secondary Snapshot Lock Expiration* field indicates that both primary and secondary locking periods are the same.
. Select the backup that you want to view.
