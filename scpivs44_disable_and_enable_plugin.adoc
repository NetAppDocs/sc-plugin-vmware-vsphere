If you no longer need the SnapCenter data protection features, you must change the configuration of the SnapCenter VMware plug-in. For example, if you deployed the plug-in in a test environment, you might need to disable the SnapCenter features in that environment and enable them in a production environment.

.Before you begin

* You must have administrator privileges.
* Make sure that no SnapCenter jobs are running.

.About this task

When you disable the SnapCenter VMware plug-in, all resource groups are suspended and the plug-in is unregistered as an extension in vCenter.

When you enable the SnapCenter VMware plug-in, the plug-in is registered as an extension in vCenter, all resource groups are in production mode, and all schedules are enabled.

.Steps
