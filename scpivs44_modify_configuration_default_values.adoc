To improve operational efficiency, you can modify the `scbr.override` configuration file to change default values. These values control settings such as the number of VMware snapshots that are created or deleted during a backup or the amount of time before a backup script stops running.

The `scbr.override` configuration file is used by the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere in environments that support SnapCenter application-based data protection operations. If this file does not exist, then you must create it from the template file.
