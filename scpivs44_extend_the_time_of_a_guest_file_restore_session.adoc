By default, an attached Guest File Restore VMDK is available for 24 hours and then it is automatically detached. You can extend the time in the *Guest Configuration* page.

.About this task

You might want to extend a guest file restore session if you want to restore additional files or folders from the attached VMDK at a later time. However, because guest file restore sessions use a lot of resources, extending the session time should be performed only occasionally.

.Steps

. In the VMware vSphere client, select *Guest File Restore*.
. Select a guest file restore session and then select the Extend Selected Guest Session icon in the Guest Session Monitor title bar.
+
The session is extended for another 24 hours.
