The minimum ONTAP privileges that are required vary according to the SnapCenter plug-ins you are using for data protection.

[NOTE]
Beginning with SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware (SCV) 5.0, you need to add applications of type HTTP and ONTAPI as user login methods for any ONTAP users with customized role-based access to the SCV. Without access to these applications, backups will fail. You need to restart the SCV service to recognize changes to ONTAP user login methods.

== Minimum ONTAP privileges required

All SnapCenter plug-ins require the following minimum privileges.

[NOTE]
You can ignore the warning messages about the unsupported vServer commands.

== Additional ONTAP information

* If you are running ONTAP 8.2.x:
+
You must login as `vsadmin` on the storage VM to have the appropriate privileges for SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere operations.

* If you are running ONTAP 8.3 and later:
+
You must login as `vsadmin` or with a role that has the minimum privileges listed in the tables above.
* You need to be the cluster admin to create and manage user roles. You can associate the users either with Cluster storage VM or with storage VM.
* You need ONTAP 9.12.1 or later versions to use SnapMirror Business Continuity (SM-BC) feature.
* To use TamperProof Snapshot (TPS) feature:
** You need ONTAP 9.13.1 and later versions for SAN
** You need ONTAP 9.12.1 and later versions for NFS

[NOTE]
For ONTAP version 9.11.1 and later, the communication to ONTAP cluster is through REST APIs. The ONTAP user should have http application enabled. However, if there are issues found with ONTAP REST APIs, the configuration key 'FORCE_ZAPI' helps the switchover to traditional ZAPI workflow. You may need to add or update this key using the config APIS and set it to true. See KB article, https://kb.netapp.com/mgmt/SnapCenter/How_to_use_RestAPI_to_edit_configuration_parameters_in_SCV[How to use RestAPI to edit configuration parameters in SCV].
