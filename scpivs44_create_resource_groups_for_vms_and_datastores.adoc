[.lead]
A resource group is the container for VMs, datastores, vSphere Tags, and vSphere VM Folders that you want to protect.

A resource group can contain the following:

* Traditional VMs and datastores
+
Any combination of traditional VMs, traditional SAN datastores, and traditional NAS datastores. Traditional VMs cannot be combined with vVol VMs.

* Flexgroup datastores
+
A single FlexGroup datastore. Spanning Flexgroup datastores are not supported. A FlexGroup datastore cannot be combined with traditional VMs or datastores.

* FlexVol datastores
+
One or more FlexVol datastores. Spanning datastores are supported.

* vVol VMs
+
One or more vVol VMs. vVol VMs cannot be combined with traditional VMs or datastores.

* vSphere tag
+
All VMs and Datastores, excluding vVol Datastores, that have the specified vSphere tag.

// Burt 1434168 3Nov2021, burt 1428684 24Nov2021 Ronya

* vVol VMs in a folder
+
All vVols in a single, specified vVol folder. If the folder contains a mix of vVol VMs and traditional VMs, SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere backs up the vVol VMs and skips the traditional VMs.
// Burt 1434168 3Nov2021, burt 1428684 24Nov2021 Ronya

For all resource groups:

[IMPORTANT]
If you are using VMware vSphere Cluster Service (vCLS), do not include VMs managed by vCLS in SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere resource groups.

For more information, refer to https://kb.netapp.com/data-mgmt/SnapCenter/SC_KBs/SCV_unable_to_backup_vCLS_VMs_after_updating_vCenter_to_7.0.x[SCV unable to backup vCLS VMs after updating vCenter to 7.0.x]

// update for https://github.com/NetAppDocs/sc-plugin-vmware-vsphere/issues/76 -Deena

[TIP]
SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere 4.5 and later supports datastores on large LUNs and files up to 128 TB with volumes up to 300 TB. If you are protecting large LUNs, use only thick provisioned LUNs to avoid latency.

[IMPORTANT]
Do not add VMs that are in an inaccessible state. Although it is possible to create a resource group that contains inaccessible VMs, backups for that resource group will fail.

.Before you begin

ONTAP tools for VMware must be deployed before you create a resource group that contains vVol VMs.

For more information, refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-tools-vmware-vsphere/index.html[ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere 9^] or https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-tools-vmware-vsphere-10/index.html[ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere 10.2^] sites based on the deployment. Refer to https://imt.netapp.com/matrix/imt.jsp?components=121034;&solution=1517&isHWU&src=IMT[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool^] for latest information about the supported versions on ONTAP tools.

.About this task

You can add or remove resources from a resource group at any time.

* Backing up a single resource
+
To back up a single resource (for example, a single VM), you must create a resource group that contains that single resource.

* Backing up multiple resources
+
To back up multiple resources, you must create a resource group that contains multiple resources.

* Resource groups that contain FlexGroup volumes in MetroCluster environments
+
If you are running on ONTAP 9.8 or ONTAP 9.9, then after a switchover or switchback, you must restart the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere service and resynchronize the SnapMirror relationships before you back up resource groups in MetroCluster environments.
+
In ONTAP 9.8, the backups hang after the switchback. This issue is fixed in ONTAP 9.9.

* Optimizing Snapshots
+
To optimize Snapshots, you should group the VMs and datastores that are associated with the same volume into one resource group.
// BURT 1378132 observation 25, March 2021 Ronya

* Backup policies
+
While you can create a resource group without a backup policy, data protection operations are only possible when at least one policy is attached to the resource group. You have the option to use an existing policy or create a new one during the resource group creation process.
[NOTE]
If you are selecting a backup policy with Snapshot locking period, you need to select ONTAP 9.12.1 or later version.  

// updated for 5.0
* Compatibility checks
+
SnapCenter performs compatibility checks when you create a resource group.
+
<<Manage compatibility check failures>>

.Steps

. In the left navigator pane of the SCV plug-in, click *Resource Groups*, then select *Create* to start the wizard.

This is the easiest way to create a resource group. However, you can also create a resource group with one resource by performing one of the following:

** To create a resource group for one VM, on the shortcuts page, select *Hosts and Clusters*, then right-click a VM, select *SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere* > *Create Resource Group*.
** To create a resource group for one datastore, on the shortcuts page, select *Hosts and Clusters*, then right-click a datastore, select *SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere* > *Create Resource Group*.

. On the *General Info & Notification* page in the wizard, do the following:
+
|===
|For this field… |Do this…

|vCenter Server
|Select a vCenter server.
|Name
|Enter a name for the resource group.
Do not use the following special characters in VM, datastore, policy,
backup, or resource group names:
% & * $ # @ ! \ / : * ? " < > - [vertical bar] ; ' , . An underscore character (_) is allowed. VM or datastore names with special characters are truncated, which makes it difficult to search for a specific backup.
In linked mode, each vCenter has a separate SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere repository. Therefore, you can use duplicate names across vCenters.
|Description
|Enter a description of the resource group.
|Notification
|Select when you want to receive notifications about operations on this resource group:
Error or warnings: Send notification for errors and warnings only
Errors: Send notification for errors only
Always: Send notification for all message types
Never: Do not send notification
|Email send from
|Enter the email address you want the notification sent from.
|Email send to
|Enter the email address of the person you want to receive the notification. For multiple recipients, use a comma to separate the email addresses.
|Email subject
|Enter the subject you want for the notification emails.
|Latest Snapshot name
a| If you want the suffix “_recent” added to the latest Snapshot, then check this box. The “_recent” suffix replaces the date and timestamp.

[NOTE]
A `_recent` backup is created for each policy that is attached to a resource group. Therefore, a resource group with multiple policies will have multiple `_recent` backups. Do not manually rename `_recent` backups.
//Burt 1471636 May2020 Ronya

|Custom Snapshot format
a| If you want to use a custom format for the Snapshot names, then check this box and enter the name format.

* By default, this feature is disabled.
* The default Snapshot names use the format `<ResourceGroup>_<Date-TimeStamp>`
However, you can specify a custom format using the variables $ResourceGroup, $Policy, $HostName, $ScheduleType, and $CustomText. Use the drop-down list in the custom name field to select which variables you want to use and the order in which they are used.
If you select $CustomText, the name format is `<CustomName>_<Date-TimeStamp>`. Enter the custom text in the additional box that is provided.
[NOTE]:
If you also select the “_recent” suffix, you must make sure that the custom Snapshot names will be unique in the datastore, therefore, you should add the $ResourceGroup and $Policy variables to the name.
// Burt 1371168  June 2021 Ronya

* Special characters
For special characters in names, follow the same guidelines given for the Name field.
|===

. On the *Resources* page, do the following:
+
|===
|For this field… |Do this…

|Scope
|Select the type of resource you want to protect:
* Datastores (all traditional VMs in one or more specified datastores). You cannot select a vVol datastore.
* Virtual Machines (individual traditional or vVol VMs; in the field you must navigate to the datastore that contains the VMs or vVol VMs).
You cannot select individual VMs in a FlexGroup datastore.
* Tags
Tag-based datastore protection is supported only for NFS and VMFS datastores, as well as for virtual machines and vVol Virtual Machines.
// updated for 5.0
* VM Folder (all vVol VMs in a specified folder; in the popup field you must navigate to the datacenter in which the folder is located)
|Datacenter
|Navigate to the VMs or datastores or folder that you want to add.
VM and Datastore names in a resource group must be unique.
|Available entities
|Select the resources you want to protect, then click *>* to move your selections to the Selected entities list.
|===
+
When you click *Next*, the system first checks that SnapCenter manages and is compatible with the storage on which the selected resources are located.
+
If the message `Selected <resource-name> is not SnapCenter compatible` is displayed, then a selected resource is not compatible with SnapCenter.
+
To globally exclude one or more datastores from backups, you must specify the datastore name(s) in the `global.ds.exclusion.pattern` property in the `scbr.override` configuration file. Refer to link:scpivs44_properties_you_can_override.html[Properties you can override].
. On the *Spanning disks* page, select an option for VMs with multiple VMDKs across multiple datastores:
+
* Always exclude all spanning datastores (This is the default for datastores.)
* Always include all spanning datastores (This is the default for VMs.)
* Manually select the spanning datastores to be included
+
Spanning VMs are not supported for FlexGroup and vVol datastores.

. On the *Policies* page, select or create one or more backup policies, as shown in the following table:
+
|===
|To use… |Do this…

|An existing policy
|Select one or more policies from the list.
|A new policy
a|
. Select *Create*.
. Complete the New Backup Policy wizard to return to the Create Resource Group wizard.
|===
+
In Linked Mode, the list includes policies in all the linked vCenters. You must select a policy that is on the same vCenter as the resource group.

. On the *Schedules* page, configure the backup schedule for each selected policy.
+
image:scpivs44_image18.png["Create resource group window"]
+
In the starting hour field, enter a date and time other than zero. The date must be in the format `day/month/year`.
// BURT 1280281 June 2021  and Burt 1457923 March 2022 Ronya
+
When you select a number of days in Every field, then backups are performed on day 1 of the month, and thereafter at every interval that is specified. For example, if you select the option *Every 2 days*, then backups are performed on day 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on throughout the month, regardless of whether the starting date is even or odd.
// BURT 1463517 April 2022 Ronya
+
You must fill in each field. SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere creates schedules in the time zone in which the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere is deployed. You can modify the time zone by using the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere GUI.
+
link:scpivs44_modify_the_time_zones.html[Modify the time zones for backups].

. Review the summary, and then click *Finish*.
+
Before you click *Finish*, you can go back to any page in the wizard and change the information.
+
After you click *Finish*, the new resource group is added to the resource groups list.
+
[NOTE]
If the quiesce operation fails for any of the VMs in the backup, then the backup is marked as not VM- consistent even if the policy selected has VM consistency selected. In this case, it is possible that some of the VMs were successfully quiesced.

== Manage compatibility check failures

SnapCenter performs compatibility checks when you attempt to create a resource group.

Reasons for incompatibility might be:

* VMDKs are on unsupported storage; for example, on an ONTAP system running in 7-Mode or on a non-ONTAP device.

* A datastore is on NetApp storage running Clustered Data ONTAP 8.2.1 or earlier.
+
SnapCenter version 4.x supports ONTAP 8.3.1 and later.
+
SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere does not perform compatibility checks for all ONTAP versions; only for ONTAP versions 8.2.1 and earlier. Therefore, always refer to https://imt.netapp.com/matrix/imt.jsp?components=121034;&solution=1517&isHWU&src=IMT[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool (IMT)^] for the latest information about SnapCenter support.

* A shared PCI device is attached to a VM.
* The preferred IP address is not configured in SnapCenter.
* You have not added the storage VM (SVM) management IP address to SnapCenter.
* The storage VM is down.

To correct a compatibility error, perform the following:

. Make sure the storage VM is running.
. Make sure that the storage system on which the VMs are located has been added to the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere inventory.
. Make sure the storage VM is added to SnapCenter. Use the Add storage system option on the VMware vSphere client GUI.
. If there are spanning VMs that have VMDKs on both NetApp and non-NetApp datastores, then move the VMDKs to NetApp datastores.
