== Delete backups

You can delete SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere backups if you no longer require the backup for other data protection operations. You can delete one backup or delete multiple backups simultaneously.

.Before you begin

You cannot delete backups that are mounted. You must unmount a backup before you can delete it.

.About this task

Snapshot copies on secondary storage are managed by your ONTAP retention settings, not by the SnapCenter VMware plug-in. Therefore, when you use the SnapCenter VMware plug-in to delete a backup, Snapshot copies on primary storage are deleted but Snapshot copies on secondary storage are not deleted. If a Snapshot copy still exists on secondary storage, the SnapCenter VMware plug-in retains the metadata associated with the backup to support restore requests. When the ONTAP retention process deletes the secondary Snapshot copy, then the SnapCenter VMware plug-in deletes the metadata using a purge job, which is executed at regular intervals.
