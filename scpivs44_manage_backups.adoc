You can rename and delete backups performed by SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere. You can also delete multiple backups simultaneously.

. On the Configure tab, select a backup,  and select *Rename*.
. On the *Rename Backup* dialog box, enter the new name, and select *OK*.
+
Do not use the following special characters in VM, datastore, policy, backup, or resource group names:  & * $ # @ ! \ / : * ? " < > - | ; ' , . An underscore character (_) is allowed.

== Delete backups

You can delete SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere backups if you no longer require the backup for other data protection operations. You can delete one backup or delete multiple backups simultaneously.

.Before you begin

You cannot delete backups that are mounted. You must unmount a backup before you can delete it.

.About this task

snapshots on secondary storage are managed by your ONTAP retention settings, not by the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere. Therefore, when you use the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere to delete a backup, snapshots on primary storage are deleted but snapshots on secondary storage are not deleted. If a snapshot still exists on secondary storage, the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere retains the metadata associated with the backup to support restore requests. When the ONTAP retention process deletes the secondary snapshot, then the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere deletes the metadata using a purge job, which is executed at regular intervals.
