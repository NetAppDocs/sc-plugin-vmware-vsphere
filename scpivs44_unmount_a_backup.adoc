You can unmount a backup when you no longer need to access the files in the datastore.

If a backup is listed as mounted in the VMware vSphere client user interface, but it is not listed in the unmount backup screen, then you need to use the REST API `/backup/{backup-Id}/cleanup` to clean up the out-of-bound datastores and then try the unmount procedure again.

If you attempt to mount a backup copy of an NFS datastore on a storage VM (SVM) with the root volume in a load-sharing mirror relationship and you might encounter the error `You might have reached the maximum number of NFS volumes configured in the vCenter. Check the vSphere Client for any error messages.` To prevent this problem, change the maximum volumes setting by navigating to *ESX* > *Manage* > *Settings* > *Advance System Settings* and changing the NFS.MaxVolumes value. Maximum value is 256.

.Steps

. In the VMware vSphere client shortcuts page select *Storage*.
. In the left navigator pane, right-click a datastore, then select *SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere* in the drop-down list, and then select *Unmount* in the secondary drop-down list.

[IMPORTANT]
Make sure that you select the correct datastore to unmount. Otherwise, you might cause an impact on production work.

. In the *Unmount Cloned Datastore* dialog box, select a datastore, select the *Unmount the cloned datastore* checkbox, and then select *Unmount*.
