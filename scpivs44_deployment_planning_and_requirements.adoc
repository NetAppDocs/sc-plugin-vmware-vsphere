You should be familiar with the following requirements before you begin deploying the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere (SCV).

== Host requirements

Before you begin deployment of SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere (SCV), you should be familiar with the host requirements.

* SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere is deployed as a Linux VM regardless of whether it is used to protect data on Windows or Linux systems.

* You should deploy the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere on the vCenter Server.
+
Backup schedules are executed in the time zone in which the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere is deployed, and vCenter reports data in the time zone in which it is located. Therefore, if the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere and vCenter are in different time zones, data in the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere Dashboard might not be the same as the data in the reports.

* You must not deploy the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere in a folder with a name that contains special characters.
+
The folder name should not contain the following special characters: $!@#%^&()_+{}';.,*?"<>|

* You must deploy and register a separate, unique instance of the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere for each vCenter Server.
** Each vCenter Server, whether in Linked Mode or not, must be paired with a separate instance of the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere.
** Each instance of the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere must be deployed as a separate Linux VM.
+
For example, suppose you want to perform backups from six different instances of the vCenter Server. In that case, you must deploy the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere on six hosts, and each vCenter Server must be paired with a unique instance of the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere.

* To protect vVol VMs (VMs on VMware vVol datastores), you must first deploy ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere. ONTAP tools provisions and configures storage for vVols on ONTAP and on the VMware web client.
+
For more information, refer to the ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere documentation. Additionally, refer to https://imt.netapp.com/matrix/imt.jsp?components=121034;&solution=1517&isHWU&src=IMT[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool^] for latest information about the supported versions on ONTAP tools.

* SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere provides limited support of shared PCI or PCIe devices (for example, NVIDIA Grid GPU) due to a limitation of the virtual machines in supporting Storage vMotion. For more information, see the vendor's document Deployment Guide for VMware.
** What is supported:
+
Creating resource groups
+
Creating backups without VM consistency
+
Restoring a complete VM when all the VMDKs are on an NFS datastore and the plug-in does not need to use Storage vMotion
+
Attaching and detaching VMDKs
+
Mounting and unmounting datastores
+
Guest file restores

** What is not supported:
+
Creating backups with VM consistency
+
Restoring a complete VM when one or more VMDKs are on a VMFS datastore.

* For a detailed list of the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere limitations, refer to link:scpivs44_release_notes.html[SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere Release Notes^].

== License requirements

|===
|You must provide licenses for… |License requirement

|ONTAP
|One of these: SnapMirror or SnapVault (for secondary data protection regardless of the type of relationship)
|Additional products
|vSphere Standard, Enterprise, or Enterprise Plus
A vSphere license is required to perform restore operations using Storage vMotion. vSphere Essentials or Essentials Plus licenses do not include Storage vMotion.
|Primary destinations
|SnapCenter Standard: required to perform application-based protection over VMware
SnapRestore: required to perform restore operations for VMware VMs and datastores only
FlexClone: used for mount and attach operations on VMware VMs and datastores only
|Secondary destinations
|SnapCenter Standard: used for failover operations for application-based protection over VMware
FlexClone: used for mount and attach operations on VMware VMs and datastores only

|SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere uses this to improve performance for restore operations. It also improves performance in NFS environments.
// Vrishali review comments  April2021 Ronya
|ONTAP tools for VMware
|SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere uses this to manage vVol datastores (VMware virtual volumes). For supported versions, refer to https://imt.netapp.com/matrix/imt.jsp?components=121034;&solution=1517&isHWU&src=IMT[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool^].
