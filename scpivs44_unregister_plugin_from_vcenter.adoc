If you stop the SnapCenter VMware plug-in service in a vCenter that is in Linked Mode, resource groups are not available in all the linked vCenters, even when the SnapCenter VMware plug-in service is running in the other linked vCenters.

You must unregister the SnapCenter VMware plug-in extensions manually.

.Steps

. On the linked vCenter that has the SnapCenter VMware plug-in service stopped, navigate to the Managed Object Reference (MOB) manager.
. In the Properties option, select *content* in the Value column, then in the next screen select *ExtensionManager* in the Value column to display a list of the registered extensions.
. Unregister the extensions `com.netapp.scv.client` and `com.netapp.aegis`.
