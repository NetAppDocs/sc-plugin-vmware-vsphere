If you want to perform application-over-VMDK workflows in SnapCenter (application-based protection workflows for virtualized databases and file systems), you must register SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere with the SnapCenter Server.

If you are a SnapCenter user and you upgraded to SnapCenter 4.2 and migrated your application-over-VMDK backups to SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware, the migration command automatically registers the plug-in.

.Before you begin

* You must be running SnapCenter Server 4.2 or later.
* You must have deployed and enabled SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere.

.About this task

* You register SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere with SnapCenter Server by using the SnapCenter GUI to add a “vsphere” type host.
+
Port 8144 is predefined for communication within the SnapCenter VMware plug-in.
+
You can register multiple instances of SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere on the same SnapCenter Server 4.2 to support application-based data protection operations on VMs. You cannot register the same SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere on multiple SnapCenter Servers.

* For vCenters in Linked Mode, you must register the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere for each vCenter.

.Steps

. In the SnapCenter GUI left navigation pane, click *Hosts*.
. Verify that the *Managed Hosts* tab is selected at the top, then locate the virtual appliance host name and verify that it resolves from the SnapCenter Server.
. Click *Add* to start the wizard.
. On the *Add Hosts* dialog box, specify the host you want to add to the SnapCenter Server as listed in the following table:
+
|===
|For this field… |Do this…

|Host Type
|Select *vSphere* as the type of host.
|Host name
|Verify the IP address of the virtual appliance.
|Credential
|Enter the username and password for the SnapCenter VMware plug-in that was provided during the deployment.
|===

. Click *Submit*.
+
When the VM host is successfully added, it is displayed on the Managed Hosts tab.

. In the left navigation pane, click *Settings*, then click the *Credential* tab, and then select *Add* to add credentials for the virtual appliance.
. Provide the credential information that was specified during the deployment of SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere.
+
[NOTE]
You must select Linux for the Authentication field.

.After you finish

If the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere credentials are modified, you must update the registration in SnapCenter Server using the SnapCenter Managed Hosts page.
