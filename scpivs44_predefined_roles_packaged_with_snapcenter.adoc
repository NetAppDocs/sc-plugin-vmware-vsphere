To simplify working with vCenter Server RBAC, the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere provides a set of predefined roles that enable users to perform SnapCenter tasks. There is also a read-only role that allows users to view SnapCenter information, but not perform any tasks.

The predefined roles have both the required SnapCenter-specific privileges and the native vCenter Server privileges to ensure that tasks are completed correctly. In addition, the roles are set up to have the necessary privileges across all supported versions of vCenter Server.

As an administrator, you can assign these roles to the appropriate users.

SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere returns these roles to their default values (initial set of privileges) each time you restart the vCenter web client service or modify your installation. If you upgrade the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere, the predefined roles are automatically upgraded to work with that version of the plug-in.

You can see the predefined roles in the vCenter GUI by clicking *Menu > Administration > Roles* as shown in the following table.
