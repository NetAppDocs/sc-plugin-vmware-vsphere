To perform add and modify storage VM operations using the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere REST APIs, you must follow the prescribed sequence of REST API calls.

For each REST API, add `\https://<server>:<port>` at the front of the REST API to form a complete endpoint.

To add storage VM operations, follow this workflow:

|===
|Step |REST API |Comments

|1
|`/4.1/storage-system`
|`Add Storage System` adds the specified storage VM to SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere.
|===

To modify storage VM operations, follow this workflow:

|===
|Step |REST API |Comments

|1
|`/4.1/storage-system`
|`getSvmAll` gets the list of all available storage VMs.
Note the *name* of the storage VM that you want to modify.
|2
|`/4.1/storage-system`
|`Modify Storage System` modifies the specified storage VM.
Pass the *name* from Step 1 in addition to all the other required attributes.
