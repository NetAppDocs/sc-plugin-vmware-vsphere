Even though backups have run successfully in the past, they might start failing when the time that the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere must wait for the storage system exceeds the configured timeout period. If this condition occurs, you can increase the configured timeout.

You might encounter the error `Unable to discover resources on SCV: Unable to get storage details for datastore <xxx>…`

.Steps

. In the VMware vSphere web client, click *Storage Systems*.
. On the Storage Systems page, select the storage system to be modified and click *Edit*.
. In the Timeout field, increase the number of seconds.

[TIP]
180 seconds is recommended for large environments.
