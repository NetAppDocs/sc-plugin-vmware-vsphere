[NOTE]
Upgrade to SCV 4.9 is supported only on VMware vCenter server 7 update 1 and later versions, for VMware vCenter server prior to version 7 update 1, you should continue to use SCV 4.7. The upgrade is disruptive on unsupported versions of VMware vCenter server.

If you are using the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere virtual appliance, you can upgrade to a newer release.
The upgrade process unregisters the existing plug-in and deploys a plug-in that is compatible only with vSphere 7.0U1 and later versions.
