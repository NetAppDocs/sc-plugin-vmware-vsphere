After performing any data protection operation using the VMware vSphere client, you can monitor the job status from the Job Monitor tab in the Dashboard and view job details.

.Steps

. In the left Navigator pane of the vSphere client, click *Dashboard*, when two or more vCenters are configured in linked mode, select a vCenter Server, and then click the *Job Monitor* tab in the Dashboard pane.
The Job Monitor tab lists each job and its status, start time, and end time. If the job names are long, you might need to scroll to the right to view the start and end times. The display is refreshed every 30 seconds.
+
* Select the refresh icon in the toolbar to refresh the display on-demand.
* Select the filter icon to choose the time range, type, tag, and status of jobs you want displayed. The filter is case sensitive.
