To perform attach and detach operations for VMDKs using the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere REST APIs, you must follow the prescribed sequence of REST API calls.

For each REST API, add `\https://<server>:<port>` at the front of the REST API to form a complete endpoint.

== To attach VMDKs, follow this workflow:

|===
|Step |REST API |Comments

|1
|Go to `\http://<vCenter-IP>/mob`
|Find the VM moref from the VMware Managed Objects URL.
Note the *moref* for the VM to which you want to attach a VMDK.
|2
|`/4.1/vm/{moref}/backups`
|`Get VM Backups` gets a list of backups for the specified VM.
Pass the *moref* from Step 1.
Note the *backupId* of the backup you want to restore.
|3
|`/4.1/vm/{moref}/backups/
{backupId}/vmdklocations`
|`Get VMDK Locations` gets a list of VMDKs for the specified VM.
Pass the *backupId* from Step 2 and the *moref* from Step 1.
Note the *vmdkLocationsList* information.
|4
|`/4.1/vm/{moref}/attachvmdks`
a|`Attach VMDKs` attaches the specified VMDK to the original VM.
Pass the *backupId* from Step 2 and the *moref* from Step 1.
Pass the *vmdkLocationsList* from Step 3 to the *vmdkLocations* attribute.

[NOTE]
To attach a VMDK to a different VM, pass the moref of the target VM in the alternateVmMoref attribute.
