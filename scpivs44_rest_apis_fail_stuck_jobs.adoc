To find job IDs for VMware vSphere web client jobs using the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere REST APIs, you must use the REST API calls for VMware vSphere. These REST APIs were added in SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere 4.4.

For each REST API, add `https://<server>:<port>` at the front of the REST API to form a complete endpoint.

Use the following REST API in the Jobs section to change jobs that are stuck in a running state to a failed state:

|===
|REST API |Comments

|`/4.1/jobs/{id}/failJobs`
|When you pass the IDs of jobs that are stuck in a running state, `failJobs` marks those jobs as failed. To identify jobs that are stuck in a running state, use the job monitor GUI to see the state of every job and the job ID.
