To perform create and modify resource group operations using the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere REST APIs, you must follow the prescribed sequence of REST API calls.

For each REST API, add `\https://<server>:<port>` at the front of the REST API to form a complete endpoint.

To create resource groups, follow this workflow:

|===
|Step |REST API |Comments

|1
|`/4.1/policies`
|`Get Policies` gets the list of VMware vSphere client policies.
Note the *policyId* that you want to use when creating the resource group and the policy *frequency*.
If no policies are listed, then use the `Create Policy` REST API to create a new policy.
|2
|`/4.1/resource-groups`
|`Create a Resource Group` creates a resource group with the specified policy.
Pass the *policyId* from Step 1 and enter the policy *frequency* details in addition to all other required attributes.
|===

To modify resource groups, follow this workflow:

|===
|Step |REST API |Comments

|1
|`/4.1/resource-groups`
|`Get List of Resource Groups` gets the list of VMware vSphere client resource groups.
Note the *resourceGroupId* that you want to modify.
|2
|`/4.1/policies`
|If you want to modify the assigned policies, `Get Policies` gets the list of VMware vSphere client policies.
Note the *policyId* that you want to use when modifying the resource group and the policy *frequency*.
|3
|`/4.1/resource-groups/
{resouceGroupId}`
|`Update a Resource Group` modifies the specified resource group.
Pass the *resourceGroupId* from Step 1.
Optionally, pass the *policyId* from Step 2 and enter the *frequency* details in addition to all other required attributes.
