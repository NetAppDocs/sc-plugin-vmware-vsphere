To perform mount and unmount operations for datastore backups using the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere REST APIs, you must follow the prescribed sequence of REST API calls.

For each REST API, add `\https://<server>:<port>` at the front of the REST API to form a complete endpoint.

== To mount datastores, follow this workflow:

|===
|Step |REST API |Comments

|1
|Go to `\http://<vCenter-IP>/mob`
|Find the datastore moref from the VMware Managed Objects URL.
Note the *moref* for the datastore that you want to mount.
|2
|`/4.1/datastores/{moref}/
backups`
|`Get the list of backups for a datastore` gets a list of backups for the specified datastore.
Pass the *moref* from Step 1.
Note the *backupId* that you want to mount.
|3
|`/4.1/datastores/backups/
{backupId}/snapshotlocators`
|`Get the list of Snapshot Locations` gets details about the location of the specified backup.
Pass the *backupId* from Step 2.
Note the *datastore* and the location from the *snapshotLocationsList*   list.
|4
|`/4.1/datastores/{moref}/
availableEsxHosts`
|`Get the list of Available Esxi Hosts` gets the list of ESXi hosts that are available for mount operations.
Pass the *moref* from Step 1.
Note the *availableEsxHostsList* information.
|5
|`/4.1/datastores/backups/
{backupId}/mount`
|`Mount datastores for a backup` mounts the specified datastore backup.
Pass the *backupId* from Step 2.
In the *datastore* and *location* attributes, pass the information from `snapshotLocationsList` in Step 3.
In the *esxHostName* attribute, pass the information from *availableEsxHostsList* in Step 4.

== To unmount datastores, follow this workflow:

|===
|Step |REST API |Comments

|1
|`/4.1/datastores/backups/
{backupId}/mounted`
|`Get the list of mounted datastores`.
Note the datastore *moref*(s) that you want to unmount.
|2
|`/4.1/datastores/unmount`

|`UnMount datastores for a backup` unmounts the specified datastore backup.
Pass the datastore *moref*(s) from Step 1.
