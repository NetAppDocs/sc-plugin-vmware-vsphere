To perform restore operations for VMDKs using the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere REST APIs, you must follow the prescribed sequence of REST API calls.

For each REST API, add `\https://<server>:<port>` at the front of the REST API to form a complete endpoint.

|Step |REST API |Comments

|1
|Go to `\http://<vCenter-IP>/mob`
|Find the VM moref from the VMware Managed Objects URL.
Note the *moref* for the VM in which the VMDK is located.
|2
|`/4.1/vm/{moref}/backups`
|`Get VM Backups` gets a list of backups for the specified VM.
Pass the *moref* from Step 1.
Note the *backupId* of the backup you want to restore.
|3
|`/4.1/vm/backups/{backupId}/
snapshotlocations`
|`Get snapshot locations` gets the location of the Snapshot for the specified backup.
Pass the *backupId* from Step 2.
Note the *snapshotLocationsList* information.
|4
|`/4.1/vm/{moref}/backups/
vmdklocations`
|`Get Vmdk Locations` gets a list of VMDKs
for the specified VM.
Note the *vmdkLocationsList* information.
|5
|`/4.1/vm/{ moref}/backups/
{backupId}/
availabledatastores`
|`Get Available Datastores` gets a list of datastores that are available for the restore operation.
Pass the *moref* from Step 1.
Pass the *backupId* from Step 2.

In the *esxHost* attribute, pass the information from *availableEsxHostsList* in Step 6.
Pass the information from Steps 3 through 5 to the *vmdkRestoreLocations* attribute:

*  In the restoreFromLocation attribute, pass the information from snapshotLocationsList in Step 3.
*  In the vmdkToRestore attribute, pass the information from vmdkLocationsList in Step 4.
*  In the restoreToDatastore attribute, pass the information from DatastoreNameList in Step 5.
