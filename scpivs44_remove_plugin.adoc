If you no longer need to use the SnapCenter data protection features, you must disable the SnapCenter VMware plug-in to unregister it from vCenter, then remove the SnapCenter VMware plug-in from vCenter, and then manually delete leftover files.

.Before you begin

* You must have administrator privileges.
* Make sure that no SnapCenter jobs are running.

.Steps

. Log in to the SnapCenter VMware plug-in management GUI using the format `\https://<OVA-IP-address>:8080`.
+
The IP of the SnapCenter VMware plug-in is displayed when you deploy the plug-in.

. Click *Configuration* in the left navigation pane, and then unselect the Service option in the *Plug-in Details* section to disable the plug-in.
. Log in to VMware vSphere.
. In the left navigator screen, right-click the instance of the SnapCenter VMware plug-in (the name of the `.tar` file that was used when the virtual appliance was deployed) and select *Delete from Disk*.
. If you used the SnapCenter VMware plug-in to support other SnapCenter plug-ins for application-consistent backups, log in to SnapCenter and remove the vSphere host.

.After you finish

The virtual appliance is still deployed but the SnapCenter VMware plug-in is removed.

After removing the host VM for the SnapCenter VMware plug-in, the plug-in might remain listed in vCenter until the local vCenter cache is refreshed. However, because the plug-in was removed, no SnapCenter VMware vSphere operations can be performed on that host. If you want to refresh the local vCenter cache, first make sure the appliance is in a Disabled state on the SnapCenter VMware plug-in Configuration page, and then restart the vCenter web client service.
