After upgrading SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere to a new patch of the same release, recent jobs or other information might not be displayed in the Dashboard and job monitor.

If you are upgrading to a new patch of the same release, you must clear the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere cache on the vCenter Web Server and restart the server before the upgrade or registration.

If the plug-in cache is not cleared, then recent jobs are not displayed in the Dashboard and job monitor in the following scenarios:

* SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere was deployed using vCenter, and then later upgraded to a patch in the same release.
* The SnapCenter VMware virtual appliance was deployed in vCenter 1. Later, this SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere was registered to a new vCenter2. A new instance of the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere is created with a patch and registered to vCenter1. However, because vCenter1 still has the cached plug-in from the first SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere without the patch, the cache needs to be cleared.

The cache is in the following locations, based on the type of server operating system:

* vCenter Server Linux Appliance
+
`/etc/vmware/vsphere-client/vc-packages/vsphere-client-serenity/`

* Windows OS
+
`%PROGRAMFILES%/VMware/vSphere client/vc-packages/vsphere-client-serenity/`

== Workaround if you already upgraded before clearing the cache

SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere service is disabled, and the extension is unregistered in vCenter.

. Locate the `vsphere-client-serenity` folder, then locate the `com.netapp.scv.client-<release-number>` folder and delete it.
+
The folder name changes for each release.

. Restart the vCenter Server.

. Log in to VMware vSphere client.
. Click *Configuration* in the left navigation pane, and then click the Service option in the *Plug-in Details* section to enable the plug-in.
