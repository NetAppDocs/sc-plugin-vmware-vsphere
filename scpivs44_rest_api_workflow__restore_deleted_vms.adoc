To perform restore operations for VM backups using the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere REST APIs, you must follow the prescribed sequence of REST API calls.

For each REST API, add `\https://<server>:<port>` at the front of the REST API to form a complete endpoint.

|1
|Go to
`\http://<vCenter-IP>/mob`
|Find the VM UUID from the VMware Managed Objects URL.
Note the *uuid* for the VM that you want to restore.
|2
|`/4.1/vm/{uuid}/backups`
|`Get VM Backups` gets a list of backups for the specified VM.
Pass the *uuid* from Step 1.
Note the *backupId* of the backup you want to restore.
|3
|`/4.1/vm/backups/{backupId}/
snapshotlocations`
|`Get snapshot locations` gets the location of the Snapshot for the specified backup.
Pass the *backupId* from Step 2.
Note the *snapshotLocationsList* information.
|4
|`/4.1/vm/{moref}/backups/
availableesxhosts`
|`Get available ESX Hosts` gets the information for the host on which the backup is stored.
Note the *availableEsxHostsList* information.
|5
|`/4.1/vm/{uuid}/backups/
{backupId}/restore`
|`Restore VM from a backup using uuid or restore a deleted VM` restores the specified backup.
Pass the *uuid* from Step 1.
Pass the *backupId* from Step 2.
Pass the information from Steps 3 and 4 in the *restoreLocations* attribute.
If the VM backup is a partial backup, set the `restartVM` parameter to "false".
*Note:* You cannot restore a VM that is a template.
