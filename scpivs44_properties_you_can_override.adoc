You can use properties that are listed in the `scbr.override` configuration file to change default values.

* By default, the template uses hash symbol to comment the configuration properties. To use a property to modify a configuration value, you must remove the `#` characters.
* You must restart the service on the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere host for the changes to take effect.

You can use the following properties that are listed in the `scbr.override` configuration file to change default values.

* *dashboard.protected.vm.count.interval=7*
+
Specifies the number of days for which the dashboard displays VM protection status.
+
The default value is "7".

* *disable.weakCiphers=true*
+
Disables the following weakCiphers for the communication channel between SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere and SnapCenter, and any additional weakCiphers that are listed in `include.weakCiphers`:
TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA256 TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA256
TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256 TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384 TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256
TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384

* *global.ds.exclusion.pattern*
+
Specifies one or more traditional or vVol datastores to be excluded from backup operations. You can specify the datastores using any valid Java regular expression.
+
Example 1: The expression `global.ds.exclusion.pattern=.*21` excludes datastores that have a common pattern; for example `datastore21` and `dstest21` would be excluded.
+
Example 2: The expression `global.ds.exclusion.pattern=ds-.*|^vol123` excludes all datastores that contain `ds-` (for example `scvds-test`) or begin with `vol123`.

* *guestFileRestore.guest.operation.interval=5*
+
Specifies the time interval, in seconds, that SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere monitors for completion of guest operations on the guest (Online Disk and Restore Files). The total wait time is set by `guestFileRestore.online.disk.timeout` and `guestFileRestore.restore.files.timeout`.
+
The default value is "5".

* *guestFileRestore.monitorInterval=30*
+
Specifies the time interval, in minutes, that the SnapCenter VMware plug-in monitors for expired guest file restore sessions. Any session that is running beyond the configured session time is disconnected.
+
The default value is "30".

* *guestFileRestore.online.disk.timeout=100*
+
Specifies the time, in seconds, that the SnapCenter VMware plug-in waits for an online disk operation on a guest VM to complete. Note that there is an additional 30-second wait time before the plug-in polls for completion of the online disk operation.
+
The default value is "100".

* *guestFileRestore.restore.files.timeout=3600*
+
Specifies the time, in seconds, that the SnapCenter VMware plug-in waits for a restore files operation on a guest VM to complete. If the time is exceeded, the process is ended and the job is marked as failed.
+
The default value is "3600" (1 hour).

* *guestFileRestore.robocopy.directory.flags=/R:0 /W:0 /ZB /CopyAll /EFSRAW /A-:SH /e /NJH /NDL /NP*
+
Specifies the extra robocopy flags to use when copying directories during guest file restore operations.
+
Do not remove `/NJH` or add `/NJS` because this will break the parsing of the restore output.
+
Do not allow unlimited retries (by removing the `/R` flag) because this might cause endless retries for failed copies.
+
The default values are `"/R:0 /W:0 /ZB /CopyAll /EFSRAW /A-:SH /e /NJH /NDL /NP"` .

* *guestFileRestore.robocopy.file.flags=/R:0 /W:0 /ZB /CopyAll /EFSRAW /A-:SH /NJH /NDL /NP*
+
Specifies the extra robocopy flags to use when copying individual files during guest file restore operations.
+
Do not remove `/NJH` or add `/NJS` because this will break the parsing of the restore output.
+
Do not allow unlimited retries (by removing the `/R` flag) because this might cause endless retries for failed copies.
+
The default values are `"/R:0 /W:0 /ZB /CopyAll /EFSRAW /A-:SH /NJH /NDL /NP"`.

* *guestFileRestore.sessionTime=1440*
+
Specifies the time, in minutes, that SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere keeps a guest file restore session active.

The default value is "1440" (24 hours).

* *guestFileRestore.use.custom.online.disk.script=true*
+
Specifies whether to use a custom script for onlining disks and retrieving drive letters when creating guest file restore sessions. The script must be located at `[Install Path]  \etc\guestFileRestore_onlineDisk.ps1`. A default script is provided with the installation. The values `[Disk_Serial_Number]`, `[Online_Disk_Output]`, and `[Drive_Output]` are replaced in the script during the attach process.
+
The default value is "false".

* *include.esx.initiator.id.from.cluster=true*
+
Specifies that the SnapCenter VMware plug-in should include iSCSI and FCP initiator IDs from all the ESXi hosts in the cluster in the application over VMDK workflows.
+
The default value is "false".

* *include.weakCiphers*
+
When `disable.weakCiphers` is set to `true`, specifies the weak ciphers that you want to be disabled in addition to the weak ciphers that `disable.weakCiphers` disables by default.

* *max.concurrent.ds.storage.query.count=15*
+
Specifies the maximum number of concurrent calls that the SnapCenter VMware plug-in can make to the SnapCenter Server to discover the storage footprint for the datastores. The plug-in makes these calls when you restart the Linux service on the SnapCenter VMware plug-in VM host.

+
The default value is "60000" (60 seconds).

* *script.virtual.machine.count.variable.name= VIRTUAL_MACHINES*
+
Specifies the environmental variable name that contains the virtual machine count. You must define the variable before you execute any user-defined scripts during a backup job.
+
For example, VIRTUAL_MACHINES=2 means that two virtual machines are being backed up.

* *script.virtual.machine.info.variable.name=VIRTUAL_MACHINE.%s*
+
Provides the name of the environmental variable that contains information about the nth virtual machine in the backup. You must set this variable before executing any user defined scripts during a backup.
+
For example, the environmental variable VIRTUAL_MACHINE.2 provides information about the second virtual machine in the backup.

* *script.virtual.machine.info.format= %s|%s|%s|%s|%s*
+
Provides information about the virtual machine. The format for this information, which is set in the environment variable, is the following: `VM name|VM UUID| VM power state (on|off)|VM snapshot taken (true|false)|IP address(es)`
+
The following is an example of the information you might provide:
+
`VIRTUAL_MACHINE.2=VM 1|564d6769-f07d-6e3b-68b1f3c29ba03a9a|POWERED_ON||true|10.0.4.2`

+
The default value is "600000" (10 minutes).

* *vmware.esx.ip.kernel.ip.map*
+
There is no default value. You use this value to map the ESXi IP address to the VMkernel IP address. By default, the SnapCenter VMware plug-in uses the management VMkernel adapter IP address of the ESXi host. If you want the SnapCenter VMware plug-in to use a different VMkernel adapter IP address, you must provide an override value.
+
In the following example, the management VMkernel adapter IP address is 10.225.10.56;  however, the SnapCenter VMware plug-in uses the specified address of 10.225.11.57 and 10.225.11.58. And if the management VMkernel adapter IP address is 10.225.10.60, the plug-in uses the address 10.225.11.61.
+
`vmware.esx.ip.kernel.ip.map=10.225.10.56:10.225.11.57,10.225.11.58; 10.225.10.60:10.225.11.61`

* *vmware.max.concurrent.snapshots=30*
+
Specifies the maximum number of concurrent VMware snapshots that the SnapCenter VMware plug-in performs on the server.
+
